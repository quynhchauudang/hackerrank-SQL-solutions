/* Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, 
but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer */

-- Đơn giản là tính tbinh lương trừ đi trbinh lương sau khi bỏ hết số 0

SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary) - AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) AS DIFFERENCE
FROM  EMPLOYEES
