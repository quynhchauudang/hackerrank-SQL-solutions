-- Problem: Median Latitude
-- Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-26/problem
-- Description:
--   A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a dataset from the lower half.
--   Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from the STATION table.
--   Round your result to 4 decimal places.

-- This approach uses a CTE with ROW_NUMBER to rank all records by LAT_N
-- and calculates the median based on whether the total number of records is odd or even.

WITH Ordered AS (
  SELECT 
    LAT_N,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS rn,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS total
  FROM STATION
),
Middle AS (
  SELECT LAT_N
  FROM Ordered
  WHERE rn = FLOOR((total + 1)/2)
     OR rn = FLOOR((total + 2)/2)
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(LAT_N), 4) AS median
FROM Middle;
